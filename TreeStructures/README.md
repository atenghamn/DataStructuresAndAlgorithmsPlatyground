# Tree data structure 

Must have a root node. Children of same parents are called siblings. 
A branch from a node to another is called an edge. 
Depth is the distance from a given node to the root. 
Height is number of edges from the root to the given node.
Child node have children.
Leaf node have no children.

## Binary tree 
Each node must have a maximum of two nodes. 

Straight binary tree - each node has exactly two children or no children.

Full binary tree - each node has exactly two children and all leaf nodes is at the same level.

Complete binary tree - each level is filled (except for the last) and the left patch i filled.

A node consists of two parts: data and a references to the child nodes.


## Binary search tree
All the right side elements should be greater than parent element.

All the left side elements should be less than parent element.
