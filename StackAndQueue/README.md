# Stack
## FILO - First In Last Out
The first object in is the last object out. If we have a stack of
2, 5, 6, 7, 1 and we want to remove 6. Then we have to remove 
1 and 7 first.

## Underflow 
Trying to remove an element when there are no elements

## Overflow
Trying push an element when the stack is full 

## Search and travel 
When searching or traveling the stack we always start at the first 
element in the stack 


# Queue
## FIFO - First In First Out 
The first object in is the first object out. If we have a queue of
2, 5, 6, 7, 1 and we want to remove 6. Then we have to remove
2 and 5 first.

## Enqueue
Add an element to the queue. Trying to add en element to a full 
queue will result in an overflow.

## Dequeue
Remove an element from the queue. Trying to remove an element from
an empty queue will result in an underflow.
